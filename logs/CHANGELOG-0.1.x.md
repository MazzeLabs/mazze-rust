# 0.1.0

## EVM Integration
- Full integration with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to enable smart contract functionality.
- Compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and DApps, allowing developers to deploy Ethereum-compatible smart contracts on the Mazze blockchain.

## DAG Blockchain Implementation
- Introduction of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) based blockchain structure to enhance scalability and transaction throughput.
- Improved confirmation times and lower transaction fees compared to traditional blockchain architectures.

## Hybrid Consensus Mechanism
- Deployment of both Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms.
- PoW: Provides security and decentralization by requiring miners to solve complex cryptographic puzzles.
- PoS: Enhances energy efficiency and scalability by allowing validators to create new blocks based on the number of tokens they hold and are willing to “stake” as collateral.
- Seamless transition mechanism between PoW and PoS to ensure network stability and security.
## RandomX PoW Integration
- Implementation of the RandomX PoW algorithm specifically designed for CPU mining.
- Enhanced resistance to ASIC mining, promoting decentralization by enabling more participants to mine using general-purpose hardware.
- Optimization for high efficiency and performance on consumer-grade CPUs.

## Improvements

- Enhanced security measures for both PoW and PoS operations.
- Improved network stability and performance through optimized DAG structure.
- Compatibility with a wide range of development tools and environments.

## Bug Fixes

- Resolved various minor bugs and issues identified during the testnet phase.
- Fixed issues related to transaction validation and block propagation.

## Known Issues

- Ongoing optimization required for seamless integration of future updates and enhancements.
- Minor performance issues under extremely high transaction loads, which are being addressed in upcoming patches.
